<p>Short post this week. The me2 team was out of the office most of the week meeting with counselors, youth organizations, and some kids. Besides that, the creative and product team was up working late trying to <em>make me2 look good</em>. <strong>Working on a new website, a video, and a new logo. Yes, a new logo!</strong></p>

<h3 id="checkoutournewdigs">Check out our new digs!</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/me2logo_new.png" alt="new me2 logo"></p>

<p>Getting a new logo for your business is always exciting. We have been working on a new logo for a few weeks now trying to get the style and colors <em>just right</em>. </p>

<p>Out with the blue and in with the green. With me2, we want to be known for an uplifting product. Having an uplifting product means having a fun and uplifting logo. We were looking to create a logo with smooth soft edges and fun calming colors to match. We think this new logo is a step in the right direction. Hope you like it as much as we do! </p>

<h1 id="ournewwebsiteiscomingalong">Our new website is coming along.</h1>

<p><strong>We are tired of looking at that ugly splash page website just as much as you are</strong> (especially because it has the old logo on it now, yuck!). I was working most of my week this week trying to fix that. I cannot share much with you yet, but I will say it is coming <em>very</em> shortly! </p>

<h1 id="me2isenteringthedreambiggrowherecontest">me2 is entering the Dream Big, Grow Here contest!</h1>

<p>From their website: "<a href="http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/">Dream Big, Grow Here</a> is an award winning business grant contest for Iowans to fulfill their dreams of self-employment or expansion of their current firm." We are entering for that exact reason, <strong>we have a dream to create a nation of happy kids.</strong> We began creating a video for the contest a couple weeks ago and since then, we have been fixing it up here and there. <em>*February 16th it will be available online for you to view and vote for us in the contest! *</em></p>

<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/">1 Million Cups</a>? To a startup or an existing business who is working on making some innovative changes 1 Million Cups is a must to participate in. This week me2 was under the spot light at <a href="https://twitter.com/1millioncupsicr">1 Million Cups ICR</a> at the Geonetric building Wednesday morning and let me tell you, it couldn't have gone better. </p>

<p>We spent a lot of time on this event. So worth it. Audience responded well to the idea with great enthusiasm.  We got feedback from people that we need to emphasis more on as well as ideas we did not quite think of yet. That is what I call a success! </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/Selection_011.png" alt="me2 presenting at 1 million cups icr"></p>

<h1 id="whatis1millioncups">What is 1 Million Cups?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/About.aspx">1 Million Cups</a> is an event found <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/Events.aspx">all over the United States</a> where entrepreneurs are able to present their business idea to their community and then receive immediate feedback. The event is held every Wednesday from 9:00am - 10am where 2 presenters present to the crowd with a 6 minute presentation followed by 20 minutes of Q and A. The point of the Q and A session is to gain interest and receive real world feedback. 1 Million Cups revolves around community. "What can the community do for you" is the mindset of 1 Million Cups which is really what makes it so special for me to present. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/1-Million-Cups.png" alt="1 million cups logo"></p>

<h1 id="ihavealwaysloved1millioncupsandnowigottopresentsomethingilove">I have always loved 1 Million Cups and now I got to present something I love!</h1>

<p>I have been attending 1 Million Cups for months now in a couple locations. I have really fallen in love with the idea behind the event. It is so inspiring seeing people present their business that they are so passionate about. I always looked forward to the day that I would present something <em>I love</em>. </p>

<p>The entire point of our me2 presentation was to get the audience to understand the product and how it can help kids. I approached the audience full of middle aged adults right away with "Remember back when <em>you</em> were in Jr. High? You had braces, a new pair of Nike shoes and dorky glasses..." to try to get their mind in the right place. </p>

<p>After getting the audience to laugh a little about those old memories, Matt and I bounced back and forth with a little skit demonstrating the product to the audience. I grabbed an old tshirt from my middle school days out of my closet and a headband I had laying around and played the role of a 14 year old from Texas named Justin. Matt played a 12 year old basketball player from Cedar Rapids named Eric. Together, both of us showed the use of me2 to the audience with these two characters we created. It was quite fun!</p>

<h1 id="doyourememberbackwhenyouwereinjrhigh">Do you remember back when you were in Jr. High?</h1>

<p>"<strong>...Well, do you remember how hard it was?..</strong>.Those high expectations. Your parents always on your case to do your homework, turn off the TV, be home by 7 while your friends were out until 9. Guess what? These times have not changed. Kids still go through these typical expectations like kids always have. But today kids have no way to escape from their issues..."</p>

<p>Today kids decide to go online to express their struggles which is great because it helps them get it off their chest but this results in bullies having 24x7 access to their victims. <em>*This is where me2 comes in. A fun, safe, positive environment for kids to go online and share their emotions. *</em></p>

<h1 id="thankyou">Thank you!!</h1>

<p>We want to give a big shout out to everyone who attended our 1 Million Cups presentation Wednesday and gave us all the amazing feedback that we were looking forward to. Our 1 Million Cups appearance was very positive and could not have gone better. If your business or organization has an idea they would like to present and receive some feedback on, I highly encourage you to speak at a 1 Million Cups event near you! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/tominsky">David Tominsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahebinder">Sarah Binder</a> for the opportunity to come to <a href="https://twitter.com/1MillionCupsICR">1 Million Cups ICR</a>. </p>

<p><strong>This week the me2 team was focused on the opening workshops of the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School</a> program.</strong> We are only 3 days into the program but I can already see the extreme benefits the program is going to be able to provide for our product, our customers, the team and most importantly: the kids. </p>

<h1 id="findthetrueproblemandthenbuildyourproduct">Find the true problem and <em>then</em> build your product.</h1>

<p>The Venture School program offered by the University of Iowa is becoming a very successful well known program now sprouting new sessions over the whole state of Iowa. The 6 week accelerated program concentrates on creating and validating a <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc">business model</a> for your business idea. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startup</a> business method, find your customers major problems and build a product from there. </p>

<p>Because of Startup Weekend, our team essentially did the opposite where we built a product from an idea and then tried to find a way that customers would pay for it. So starting out Venture School we had to somewhat start over with our business idea. They had us all stop thinking about our product and instead find the true problems of our customer and then rebuild our product from this knowledge. </p>

<p>This week our team along with 9 other startups worked all day Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on the <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/10/24/17577/">value proposition and customer segment</a> of the business model. These help you discover the true needs of your customer along with who your customer truly is. <em>What</em> is the problem and <em>who</em> has the problem?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/01/value-prop-design.jpg" alt=""></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Each team came into the program with a business model draft completed where we all found out quickly that they are all quite wrong. Each day of the opening workshops we gave everyone an update to our buisness model through a pitch presentation. <strong>It turns out that none of the groups, including us, truly know what value we are delivering through our product.</strong> </p>

<p>When stating the value that your business gives to your customer, it has nothing to do with your product. Do not even think about your product. What is the true problem of your customer? With me2 being the example, the fact that me2 provides emotional support to kids is <em>not</em> a value. Value propositions need to be proven false depending on who you talk to. Everyone agrees that happiness is important to a child so that is not value. <strong>What is the true problem to your customer?</strong> Sure emotional support is important to a child but that is a <em>feature</em> of the product. What does emotional support <em>do</em> for kids? That is more of what a value proposition should be. </p>

<h1 id="ventureschoolhasallowedustotakeastepback">Venture school has allowed us to take a step back.</h1>

<p>Being pulled back from building the product and instead starting with step one doing customer validation to find the true problem you are trying to solve is the best decision for a startup to make. You have a cool idea? Great! Now just be patient and spend some time validating that your idea truly solves a problem. </p>

<p>We are taking this time to talk to people and practice some team building. It is like starting from scratch but not completely. We are simply taking a step back to make the product better. So far I am a true believer in the lean startup method. Startups are not just small versions of big businesses. They take a completely different approach. Go on, give it a try!</p>

How you prepare for battle. -- week 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2</h1>

<p><strong>The me2 team has been in discovery mode</strong>. Lots and lots of research across the board. We are spending time preparing for some tasks in the weeks to come. The marketing team was actively researching organizations in the area to connect with while the development team was doing a refresher on some old knowledge. Simply put, we are preparing for battle (our launch day. The day we enter the market).</p>

<p>It was a quiet week in the office where everyone had their headphones on tight staring at the computer screen with some phone calls on the side. We have been preparing some website and social media content to connect with all the positive kids out there but besides that, it has been all business.</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="wehavebeenconductingalotofresearch">We have been conducting a lot of research.</h1>

<p>What is funny is now that I think about it, we did not really plan on conducting research as a team, we just naturally started to do it. The marketing team discussed it amongst each other and decided to conduct various types of marketing research such as social media techniques and customer discovery (You know, the typical market research that all businesses conduct when first starting out). <strong>Startups know of a problem they are trying to solve but they need to know that problem inside and out to the best of their ability if they want to <em>truly</em> solve that problem.</strong></p>

<p>We are entering a market that none of us are experts at. All of us were kids once and we all went through some hard times but that does not make us experts. In order to conduct business in a market, you need to understand the market to the very best of your ability. We have some great ideas about our market and users but it can always be better. From advice we have received, spending some good time to better understand the industry you are entering is time well spent. </p>

<h1 id="thisresearchisnotjustexclusivetothebusinesssideofthebusiness">This research is not just exclusive to the business side of the business...</h1>

<p>...even the development side has been conducting research! I have been researching for weeks now on the product side making decisions on the technologies and techniques we will be using to build our platform. This week specifically I was refreshing my knowledge on some web technologies that I have not used in a while. Brad, our designer, is also beginning to  research some design techniques we will be needing in the future. </p>

<p>From a product standpoint, my team is also preparing for battle. We hope that once we release our product, kids absolutely fall in love with it. Kids are going to count on this product being available at all times especially when they are at their worst and need that emotional support that we are providing. Our platform needs to be dependable and able to stand up to stress. I am preparing our team to build a safe, dependable, stable platform available to all of our users they will love. </p>

<h1 id="onceyoustartthereisnostopping">Once you start, there is no stopping.</h1>

<p>Once you enter battle, it becomes harder to make changes. Starting out a business, making those key decisions early on that you are going to be able to tolerate months or years down the road are important to make. Prepare your army then jump right in! Once you start, it is full steam ahead with no slowing down so better be prepared now then later!</p>

The me2 team is now working all day every day making dreams come true. It is only a matter of time now until kids have a safe environment on the Internet to have fun and support each other. </p>

<h1 id="weareme2">We are me2.</h1>

<p>For those of you who may not know, we are me2. A safe environment online for kids where they can support each other to get through their hard times. Every young person struggles at some point in life so we are here to provide that environment where they feel safe to express that. </p>

<p>Monday of this week we started working full-time out of the <a href="http://crvault.com/">Vault</a> co-working space in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Co-working is the idea of many different people all working on different projects sharing office space together to create an environment that encourages collaberation, positive energy and motivation. Moving into the Vault was a decision that we made to help us work as hard as possible through our launch where we can be with people with the same dream as us: create and maintain a successful business. The Vault has been around for a few years now in a beautiful building where many successful businesses started out of. How inspiring!</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/01/IMAG0476.jpg" alt="vault logo on wall"></p>

<h1 id="whatistocomeverysoon">What is to come very soon.</h1>

<p>Our team spent a bit of time this week doing a great deal of meeting members of the Vault space and doing some team organization to get everyone's schedules figured out. Besides that, we spent a great deal of time planning out some fun social media activities that we will be starting soon so be sure to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/me2nation">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/me2nation">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/me2nation">Facebook</a> pages to keep up with that (have your kids follow us if they are on any of these networks with permission from their parents of course). We also have a new <a href="http://me2nation.com/">website splash page</a> created until our website is complete. We have also started a new <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com/">company blog</a> (which you are reading this from) that we will use to share out experiences and progress on every week. </p>

<h2 id="evenmoreexcitingnews">Even <em>more</em> exciting news.</h2>

<p>me2 is very excited to announce that we have been chosen to participate in the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School program</a> starting January 20th! Venture School is a 6 week accelerated program for new startup companies to validate their business and ultimately raise their chances of success through networking, mentoring and customer discovery. We have big plans for Venture School where the sky is the limit. </p>

<p>Everyone here at me2 is moving at full speed making progress to launch the me2 web and mobile app. We have been thinking of some <em>very</em> cool ideas that we cannot wait to share with all of you. Thank you everyone for your continued support. </p>
