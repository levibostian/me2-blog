           <h2 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2</h2>

<p>For those of you who have been watching our progress, you know that here at me2 we follow the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">lean startup methodology</a>. We have been going through an accelerated business startup program called <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> which follows the lean startup methodology very strictly. We have been focusing our time on the customer discovery phase where we are busy validating our business to see if it is truly viable (our users <em>truly</em> have a problem and our solution <em>truly</em> solves this problem). Luckily for us we found out now that our revenue model and product were not going to work quite the way we originally thought. Gotta love the lean startup!</p>

<h2 id="pivotsareagoodthingfailnoworfaillater">Pivots are a good thing. Fail now, or fail later.</h2>

<p>We have spent the past month talking to schools, counselors, life coaches, kids, parents, and youth organizations about their pain points day-to-day we to see where me2 could fit into their lives (this is known as the customer discovery phase of the lean startup methodology). What we heard was that <strong>me2 does indeed have a place in the lives of kids but it is not quite what the industry it looking for.</strong></p>

<p>When starting a business, the revenue model is the business's plan to generate revenue to ultimately stay operational. The thing about revenue models is that they need to work <em>with</em> the industry. Your industry might be in desparate need for your product and they might be willing to pay you money for your solution but then again, maybe they are not interested in your solution or not willing to pay money to receive it. <strong>It doesn't matter how hard you work or how amazing you are at sales your revenue model might be impossible.</strong> You might have the absolute best sales team in the entire world but if the industry is not looking for your solution or are not willing to pay money for it, then you need to ditch the model, pivot your business, and find a different way of making money. </p>

<p>Following that note, we are pivoting our revenue model. We originally built a business model around providing some sort of tool for professionals to use to better tailor their program/service according to emotional trends in kids. After customer discovery, we discovered that our industry (teenagers emotional health) is not looking for this type of solution. </p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/02/Selection_032.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pivots get your business to success. Be open to pivots. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When some hear the word "pivot" they might think negatively on it because that means the product or service is now delayed in release because all previous work is now garbage and you decide to change focus. To us, we have learned that pivots are actually a great event. Sure, the app might not come out a month or two later because we have more discovery to conduct on this new revenue model but we decided to pivot now to avoid having to pivot later. Like I mentioned before, a revenue model could either work or not work no matter how hard you try. You could either dump all your time, money and energy into a model that will release sooner but fail eventually after you launch it. Or you could choose the other path where you pivot now, develop and validate a new model, launch a little later then you originally hoped for but launch a successful product with a successful model. We chose the second path. </p>

<p>It is safe to say that pretty much every business goes through a pivot at some point in time. How on Earth could you make all of the right decisions and create all the right solutions to life's challenges? There comes a time when your idea will not work out the way you thought it was going to. Be open to pivots. They help you in the end. Accept your idea was not going to work and get back to work. Don't be scared. </p>

<h2 id="ourlastweekofventureschoolreallygoingtomissit">Our last week of Venture School. Really going to miss it...</h2>

<p><strong>The wonderful 6 week accelerated business validation program of Venture School is coming to an end this week.</strong> Venture School has been the greatest thing that has happened for me2 yet and we are really going to miss it. So many great things to say about this program where do I start?! </p>

<p>This Thursday and Friday the me2 team will be at the University participating in workshops, lectures, and practicing for the big pitch event Friday morning that we have all been looking forward to all along. </p>

<p>Friday morning each of the 10 teams in the program will give a 8 minute pitch demonstrating all of the hard work that we have done the past 6 weeks in the program. It is our time to show what we have validated, what we have not validated, and what we are going to do next after leaving the program. An exciting event where we cannot wait to share all of our hard work. </p>

<hr />

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> is growing. They are expanding the program to more cities across the state of Iowa. If you have a business idea, the best decision you could ever make for your idea is send it through Venture School to exercise the lean startup methodology. Give your idea some wheels! Ask myself or any of the me2 team members, we will all recommended it to you in the fullest extent. </p>

<h2 id="wegotanewwebsite">We got a new website!!</h2>

<p>Good by ugly uninformative website and hello to <strong><a href="http://me2nation.com/">our new site</a></strong>! We have wanted somewhere that we can send people that we meet to explain more about what me2 is all about and we think the new me2nation website is a step in the right direction. </p>

<h2 id="thosedreambiggrowherevotescontinuetoflowin">Those Dream Big, Grow Here votes continue to flow in.</h2>

<p>The me2 team is participating in the Dream Big, Grow Here contest competing against a large handful of other businesses in the pre-revenue stage of business. <strong>We continue to spread awareness of our dream of creating a nation of happy kids and you can help us.</strong> The best thing to do is share <a href="http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/EntryDetails.aspx?entry=1072">this website</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HtkJw5HoxQ">our awesome video</a> to people that you know who would love to see hope in the eyes of kids around the nation. </p>
