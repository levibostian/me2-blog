           <h3 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2.</h3>

<p>Not too much to share this week from the me2 team. This week consisted of lots of odd jobs here and there and some paperwork. We are still conducting conversations together as a team to discuss the vision of me2 (what a great title of our blog post today, huh?). Hopefully some exciting news will be shared in the near future with everyone! </p>

<h2 id="vision">Vision.</h2>

<p>Where do you see your business in one month from today? What about 1 year from today? Or even 100 years from today? What will the business model look like? How many customers/users/members are you expecting? What products will your company offer? Will you see yourself involved still or do you see someone taking your place? Will your orgnaization even exist anymore? Vision is very important to a company and it is something that I think we seem to forget about sometimes. I spent some time refreshing my ideas on me2's vision and wanting to remind you to do it as well. </p>

<h3 id="trytotaketimetostepbackfromthebusinessmodelforaminute">Try to take time to step back from the business model for a minute.</h3>

<p>We have spent the past 13 weeks on the me2 business model. Finding the product market fit, revenue model, competitors, etc. Sure, the business model is extremely important to a business but what if that business model does not align with the vision of the team? No matter what the business model is, I feel that if your vision does not align with the business model then the business is not able to succeed. </p>

<h5 id="whyareyouhere">Why are <em>you</em> here?</h5>

<p>Ask yourself "Why am I here?". Why am I apart of me2? My initial reaction is "for the kids" but there is much more to everyone's story besides just the broad basic answer. Think harder at this question. Maybe you are trying to find an idea that will make you rich within the next year. Maybe it is to gain experience in a startup business. Maybe it is to create an app from scratch or have the opportunity to go through a series A funding round. Think long and hard because there are dozens of reasons big and small for why you are involved in a business. </p>

<p>If a business model states that your business is going to release a product in 10 months, raise 3.5 million dollars in funding to launch an MVP, and is designed to take down Google does this plan align with the reason <em>you</em> are involved in the business? Does this sound like something <em>you</em> want to be a part of? Does this business plan get <em>your</em> heart racing with excitment? </p>

<h4 id="thisiswhereigotthinking">This is where I got thinking...</h4>

<p>Like I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com/scrum-to-the-rescue-week-12/index.html">last week's post</a> along with this post, the me2 team is having conversations together about our vision. A couple weeks ago I took a step back at our business model and what it has developed into. I compared the business model with the vision that I saw for me2 and didn't quite see it align. There were places that they aligned together, but there were other parts that seemed to split into 2 different paths. </p>

<p>When this happens, it is time to take a step back and rethink the company vision. What do you need to change about the business model and company vision to make them align? Once you modify the business model and vision a little here and there to make them align, make sure everyone individually thinks about this new vision to see if that vision aligns with "why am I here?". If not, do you want to continue with the business? </p>

<h5 id="againtakingastepbackisagoodthing">Again, taking a step back is a good thing.</h5>

<p>Anytime you are told to "take a step back" in a startup it sounds like a bad idea as it can slow you down but we have taken a couple steps back already as early as <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com/taking-a-step-back-sometimes-is-so-worth-it-week-3/index.html">week 3</a> and it is so worth it. Is it better to rethink your vision now or in a few months when the business has turned into something you are not comfortable being a part of anymore? This is what startups are all about. They are extremely fragile. If you are on the edge of comfort, the business will fail. Make sure the company's vision aligns with your vision. If they do not align, take a moment to see what you need to do to feel more comfortable. If it does align, hop on and enjoy the ride! Get ready for success! </p>
