<p>Have you seen our <a href="https://facebook.com/me2nation">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/me2nation">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://instagram.com/me2nation">Instagram</a> pages? If you are ever in need of some morning motivation or inspiration for the next day then check them out. Thanks to Jordan our social media pages are off the hook. All of the positive inspiring posts our social media accounts publish every day makes me want to go out there and change the world!</p>

<p>We are getting closer and closer to the start of development. We see the need for me2 through the conversations we have had with kids/teens and we feel it is time to test it out with them. Late this week I began to set up the basic code base and will continue to do so to begin building me2. We are so excited to get this product in the hands of kids/teens and watch what happens. </p>

<h2 id="revenuefindingapainpointinsomeoneslifeandhavingtheabilitytosolveit">Revenue = Finding a pain point in someone's life and having the ability to solve it.</h2>

<p>I have spoken previously about how the me2 team has been conducting validation on our revenue model figuring out how we are able to become a sustainable. Included in this validation is the decision to turn me2 into a for-profit or non-profit organization. </p>

<p>A month or so ago we had discussions as a team deciding if me2 would become a for-profit or non-profit organization. There are so many options when it comes to entities: LLC, B-Corp, S-Corp, 501c, and <em>tons</em> more that are all potential options for me2. We were weighing the pros and cons and decided to ask a mentor for help. After speaking with someone who is an expert in establishing non-profit organizations after starting a few of his/her own we found out that we were trying to solve the problem from the wrong direction. <strong>After talking to a mentor we discovered that the revenue model would decide for-profit or non-profit for us.</strong> Example: advertising => for-profit. Grants => non-profit. </p>

<p>Along with the revenue model, we also need to keep in mind the visions of the team. What is the goal we are trying to accomplish with me2? Where do we want to see it in 5 years? What is your true vision? All of these questions go into the decision of for-profit or non-profit. </p>

<h3 id="howdoyouvalidatearevenuemodel">How do you validate a revenue model?</h3>

<p><strong>Validating a revenue model consists of finding a point point in someone's life that you can provide a solution for.</strong> For me2, we are in the emotional health industry so we need to examine <em>everyone</em> involved in this industry and ask them "what do you do in your day to day life?" and "If there was one thing that you wish you could change, what would it be?". When you ask these questions you may hear what you were hoping to hear but you may also become disappointed because you may not be able to provide a solution to them after all. Either way, <em>good</em> validation is key to validating a revenue model. </p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> go into a conversation with someone with the goal in mind that you are going to see if they would be interested in your product. With this mindset, you tend to not validate anything at all. Your conversation should truly be a conversation. Get an idea of that person's life. What is important to them. What parts of their life do they love and what parts do they hate. This is not a sales pitch. It is discovering a pain point in their life somewhere they would be willing to pay money for fixing. </p>

<p>Here is an example: when the me2 team and I began conducting validation on our product, we would go up to people and say "Every kid goes through tough times in life. What if I told you there was this app...(long period of time where you explain the entire product to the user including all the features)...that make you feel happier? Would you use it?" Of course, the answer is going to always be, "Yes! I would use a product that makes me happier! Where do I sign up?" Everyone wants to be happier. Why would they say no to this question? That validation that you just conducted was a huge waste of time and you did not learn anything. You told your customer what their problem is (you told the kid that they go through tough times and they want to feel happier) when you should instead have them tell you their problems. </p>

<p>What if I was to instead ask this kid, "Think about the last time that you were going through a tough time and you needed to ask someone for advice. How long ago was it? Walk me through the step-by-step process you did to get from tough time to receiving advice. Do you always do that process or was that unique?" When we ask these questions, we understand we might get rejected. Some kid might say to us that the last time they needed help was 6 months ago and they immediately went to their parents for help. This is news that we don't really want to hear because that means they are not a potential user for us but it is good validation. It is good that we are hearing this information now rather than months down the road when we make this product and give it to this same kid and wonder "why on Earth is he/she not using the app?!". Maybe after you receive all of this feedback, you find out that a large majority of kids go exclusively to their parents when they need help. From knowing this information you can then decide if you want to ditch the idea altogether or pivot the idea to make an app that connects kids to their parents in a convenient way that they can quickly and easily ask for advice. </p>

<p>Remember a while back when I wrote about <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com/we-made-a-pivot-be-open-to-change-it-gets-you-closer-to-success-week-7/index.html">our pivot</a> that we went though? This pivot felt good for many reasons and one of those reasons was because it meant that we conducted good validation. We went to counselors and asked them "tell me about your day to day life as a school counselor". They then proceeded to talk about how they spend most of their day talking to students one-on-one to help them through a particular situation they are going through and then they do some various other things around the school such as meeting with administration or organizing some career event. Our assumption going into this conversation was that counselors did activities that included the entire student body. They want to use tools that would help all of the students in the entire school to become happier and they are willing to pay money for it...right? Well...</p>

<p>Through our validation questions as well as repeatedly asking them "why?..." after they would answer a question to gain more detail we found out this is not the case. Our assumption was incorrect as our conversation we had did not include anything about making their entire student body happier. </p>

<h3 id="dontforgetaboutyourvision">Don't forget about your vision.</h3>

<p>Sure, a revenue model is important but don't forget about the vision of your company. What is the ultimate goal of your organization? Is it to make all of the founders rich and famous? Is it to provide a solution to just simply gain traction into a market and release a better product later on once traction is made? Is it to feed 100 starving kids in Asia every month? All of these visions are truly valid choices. What are the goals of your organization individually and as a team?</p>

<p>Even if we end up finding a pain point somewhere along the way of our discovery, does it align with the goals of the team members of me2? For example: If the revenue model is designed to make the founders super stinkin rich but yet none of the founders want to be super stinkin rich then why would you go down that path? Revenue models are important but the goals and visions you set for your organization are most important. Don't forget about them. </p>

<h4 id="shoutouttoventureschoolagain">Shout out to Venture School (again)</h4>

<p>I just wanted to quick shout out the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> program that we talk about so much. This post would be exist if it was not for them. I would have written here today "go out there with a 10 question true/false survey and get 50 people to do and for your validation" but after going through this great experience I am doing the complete opposite. Such a great experience so again, Thank you!</p>
