<p>If you have kept up with our weekly updates, the me2 team participated in a 6 week accelerated startup program called <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> that finished up a week ago. As a little reward, each of us decided to have some fun this week in various ways. One member is halfway across the globe, one is on the East Coast, I went on a trip with one of our mentors to a speaking event as well as participated in a business pitch competition. </p>

<h3 id="pitchandgrowxxcompetition">Pitch and Grow XX competition</h3>

<p>Thursday of last week I participated in the Technology Association of Iowa's <a href="http://www.technologyiowa.org/en/events_services/pitch__grow/pitch__grow_xx__cedar_valley_030515/">Pitch and Grow XX</a> pitch competition. Pitch competitions are a great opportunity to practice your pitch and improve on it. Your pitch is never perfect but you can always work to make it better! </p>

<h4 id="grabyouraudiencesemotionsandtheywilllisten">Grab your audience's emotions and they will listen.</h4>

<p>A couple years ago I attended a Pitch and Grow competition where one of my really good friends <a href="http://www.spencerdailyreporter.com/story/1992233.html">took first place</a> for his pitch of <a href="http://www.anvil-guitars.com/">Anvil Guitars</a>. Aaron, the owner of Anvil Guitars, gave an amazing presenation to the audience where he showed how much he truly was in love with building custom made guitars. Anvil Guitars exists because of the passion that Aaron has for quality. He puts his heart and soul into everything that he builds with his bare hands. </p>

<p>I remember watching the entire crowd having their eyes glued on the front of the screen, speechless, smiles on their face, listening to every single word that Aaron had to say. Even if they had no interest in guitars, everyone for those few minutes were in love with guitars. It was then that I learned how valuable it was to show how much you truly love your business when you pitch. Aaron won the crowd over to deliver a giant message and ended up winning the compeitition. </p>

<p>When I was preparing the pitch for Pitch and Grow XX, I had Aaron constantly in the back of my mind where I had to find some way of grabbing onto the emotions of the audience. What better way then getting them to think back to back when they were in Jr High?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/Selection_036.png/" alt="remember back when you were in jr high"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do <em>you</em> remember back when you were in Jr. High?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Remember back when you were in Jr. High? You had braces, some new Nike shoes and some dorky glasses. Remember going out for basketball, vollyball, and band? Oh, and don't forget those precious dances with your sweet heart you used to go to!"</strong> This was how I opened up the pitch presentation at the competition. I had a lot of fun with it because I watched everyone in the crowd get a big smile on their face and give me some good laughs while viewing the classic 1970s portrait pictures up on the screen I showed off. It was working! After the pitch was over, I asked a handful of people what was on their mind at the very beginning of the pitch and they said they were thinking about memories of when they were in Jr High. That was what I was looking for!</p>

<h5 id="alwaysimprovethatpitch">Always improve that pitch.</h5>

<p>Every time that we pitch me2 to people, we try our best to answer all of those typical questions that we receive each and every time that we pitch. Lets answer those questions in the pitch so we can move on and get new feedback! I felt <em>very</em> good during the competition because all of the feedback that we got from the judges was all new feedback! I am going back right now and improving our pitch to match what they said so next time we see them, we can get even better feedback. <strong>Always improve that pitch!</strong> </p>

<p>I decided to go to the Pitch and Grow competition because I wanted to get the chance to practice our pitch to become better at speaking as well as receiving new feedback on our presentation. What was super awesome was that the judges liked my pitch so well the first time I presented that day that I got to pitch a second time that day in the final pitch off round of the competition! The pitch competition was such a great experience and I look forward to the next one. If you know of a pitch competition happening, please send it my way. </p>

<h4 id="speakingofgrabbingyouraudiencesemotions">Speaking of grabbing your audience's emotions...</h4>

<p>Do you know <a href="http://www.joshuacoburn.com">Josh Coburn</a>? If you don't, then you should. Josh is a life coach, speaker, entrepreneur, mentor and just all around wonderful human being. We met Josh a couple months ago and since then we have had the great opportunity to speak with him a number of times to pick his brain on some thoughts we had on me2. We have had great interactions together on the phone but I wanted to get to know him a little better. Last Friday I took a trip with him to one of his speaking events and let me tell you, it was in my top inspirational talks I have ever witnessed in the my life. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/josh_coburn.jpg/" alt="Josh Coburn"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Josh Coburn. Breaking down stereotypes each and every day. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the society that we live in, when you first see Josh you may think that he doesn't belong because of the way that he looks. Josh takes advantage of this to break down stereotypes to show the world that the stereotypes he represents are absolutely wrong. Josh is one of the most kindest people you will ever meet in your entire life. So kind that he invited me to join him when he went to Bondurant-Farrar High School to watch him speak last Friday. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/josh_coburn_bondurant_farrar_high_school.jpg/" alt="Josh at Bondurant-Farrar High School"></p>

<p>Josh speaks to the audience during his speaking events about the times in his life that may not have been the best moments in his life. He gives the crowd everything he has with no barriers. He has a talent for grabbing onto the emotions of every student in the crowd and gets them to listen to the message he has to give. Every student can relate in one way or another to Josh because they know life can be tough. Josh is on their team every step of the way and he shows it. I had such a great day with Josh that day <strong>watching him change the lives of hundreds of young adults in the matter of less then an hour</strong>. </p>

<p>I have mentioned Josh a few times previously in our posts and you will hear more. Josh has so much to offer to what we are trying to accomplish here at me2. It is an honor to know him. He does such a great job with the students that he speaks with at his events. Students will give him his life stories and ask for advice when they first introduce themselves to him. There is never a question that you cannot ask Josh and I respect that very much. Such a great guy. </p>

<h5 id="itcomestoshowthatagainthatgrabbingontoyouraudiencesemotionswillgiveyoualloftheirattention">It comes to show that again that grabbing onto your audience's emotions will give you all of their attention.</h5>

<p><strong>We did it!</strong> We survived the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> program! 6 weeks of intense customer discovery to validate our business model to increase the chances of success for me2. It was a tough 6 weeks but we are done...or are we?!</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/survived_venture_school.png/" alt="we survived Venture School"></p>

<h3 id="wesurvivedventureschool">We survived Venture School.</h3>

<p>Last week was dedicated our week entirely to our final Venture School pitch Friday morning. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were spent all day working on our slide deck. Thursday was spent at the University sitting in on some last lectures and discussions about how to give a perfect presentation. Then came the big day Friday where all 10 teams gave their final pitch of the program to demonstrate what they have learned and accomplished over the course of the program. </p>

<p>Our slides consisted of a general non-technical overview of how the product works, a timeline of milestones we aim to hit from now until early 2016, an outline of key partnerships, competition table, team members slide, and more. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/Selection_035.png/" alt="first slide of pitch deck"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First slide of pitch deck. Looked really good up on a big screen! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After an entire week of preperation, the big moment finally came. Friday morning the team and I woke up and headed to the University one last time. This was our time to show what we have worked so hard at the past 6 weeks. Matt and I stood at the front and began our pitch...</p>

<h4 id="standupifyourparentsaredivorced">"Stand up if your parents are divorced."</h4>

<p><strong>Kind of makes you jump a little in your seat doesn't it? This was how I started out our pitch.</strong> A few weeks ago I was on YouTube watching one of <a href="http://www.joshuacoburn.com/">Joshua Coburn</a>'s talks he did at a high school. Josh is known for being serious in his talks (<em>which is one reason why he is so absolutely amazing at what he does</em>) and he enjoys asking the audience to participate by asking them serious questions like if their parents are divorced. I was watching his talk and when he asked the audience to stand up after he asked a serious question, I did not know how to respond. Are people really going to stand up?! Within 2 seconds, a handful or so stood up immediately and then after another 10 seconds, half of the entire audience was standing. The emotion in that room was astonishing. I was blown away that Josh was able to grab their emotions and show them that <strong>they were not alone. They could all relate together on that one life experience. That is what I wanted to do in our presentation.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/B-3TkHzUIAA4lyJ.jpg/" alt="Matt and I pitching Friday morning"></p>

<p>After the presentation my team and I were very proud of what we did on center stage. We came to impress and we felt we succeeded. However we were not going to find out for sure until after all 10 teams did their pitch and we could talk to the mentors listening in. </p>

<p>After the 10 teams finished up their pitch, the results we heard from people were awesome! Everyone that we talked to afterwards said we had a super pitch. They did say that in the beginning when we asked for people to stand if their parents were divorced was a little uncomfortable but it did the job. We are ok with the fact that it was a little different. If we are able to get our audience to understand the fact that they are not alone, we did our job. </p>

<h4 id="wewonbestcustomerdiscovery">We won Best Customer Discovery!!!</h4>

<p>Friday after all 10 teams pitched their final presentations, the mentors got together and voted on teams to acknowledge their accomplishments. <strong>me2 won the Best Customer Discovery award!!!</strong> We are very proud of this accomplishment because the whole 6 week Venture School program revolves around conducting Customer Discovery so if the mentors say we had the best discovery, I would say that is a pretty good compliment! </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/03/IMAG0542.jpg/" alt="me2 won best customer discovery award"></p>

<h3 id="wearedonewiththeventureschoolprogrambutventureschoolliveson">We are done with the Venture School program, but Venture School lives on.</h3>

<p>Sure, we completed the Venture School program but that does not mean that we are done with Venture School activities. Venture School is an accelerated 6 week program to validate your business model. However, we have not yet fully validated our business model. We still have many weeks ahead of us that we need to conduct validation on many aspects of the business model. </p>

<h3 id="onelastthankyoutoventureschoolandtheleanstartup">One last THANK YOU to Venture School and the lean startup.</h3>

<p>I have said it once and I will say it again, Venture School and the lean startup methodology have been the greatest things that has happened to me2. We sent our little baby through a program to test what it was made of. Along the way, it got bullied a little here and there and congradulated periodically. When the program ended, our once little baby gained a lot of maturity. We are not ready to let our little baby go out into the real world yet but it is on its way. We are proud of what me2 has turned out to be in just these short 6 weeks. </p>

<p>If you have not yet, read <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/booktj">The Lean Startup</a>. This is how we run our startup business and we all feel that you should run yours like it too. </p>

<p>Thank you Venture School! Thank you lean startup! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>

Be open to change, it gets you closer to success. -- week 7]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2</h2>

<p>For those of you who have been watching our progress, you know that here at me2 we follow the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">lean startup methodology</a>. We have been going through an accelerated business startup program called <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> which follows the lean startup methodology very strictly. We have been focusing our time on the customer discovery phase where we are busy validating our business to see if it is truly viable (our users <em>truly</em> have a problem and our solution <em>truly</em> solves this problem). Luckily for us we found out now that our revenue model and product were not going to work quite the way we originally thought. Gotta love the lean startup!</p>

<h2 id="pivotsareagoodthingfailnoworfaillater">Pivots are a good thing. Fail now, or fail later.</h2>

<p>We have spent the past month talking to schools, counselors, life coaches, kids, parents, and youth organizations about their pain points day-to-day we to see where me2 could fit into their lives (this is known as the customer discovery phase of the lean startup methodology). What we heard was that <strong>me2 does indeed have a place in the lives of kids but it is not quite what the industry it looking for.</strong></p>

<p>When starting a business, the revenue model is the business's plan to generate revenue to ultimately stay operational. The thing about revenue models is that they need to work <em>with</em> the industry. Your industry might be in desparate need for your product and they might be willing to pay you money for your solution but then again, maybe they are not interested in your solution or not willing to pay money to receive it. <strong>It doesn't matter how hard you work or how amazing you are at sales your revenue model might be impossible.</strong> You might have the absolute best sales team in the entire world but if the industry is not looking for your solution or are not willing to pay money for it, then you need to ditch the model, pivot your business, and find a different way of making money. </p>

<p>Following that note, we are pivoting our revenue model. We originally built a business model around providing some sort of tool for professionals to use to better tailor their program/service according to emotional trends in kids. After customer discovery, we discovered that our industry (teenagers emotional health) is not looking for this type of solution. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/Selection_032.png/" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pivots get your business to success. Be open to pivots. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When some hear the word "pivot" they might think negatively on it because that means the product or service is now delayed in release because all previous work is now garbage and you decide to change focus. To us, we have learned that pivots are actually a great event. Sure, the app might not come out a month or two later because we have more discovery to conduct on this new revenue model but we decided to pivot now to avoid having to pivot later. Like I mentioned before, a revenue model could either work or not work no matter how hard you try. You could either dump all your time, money and energy into a model that will release sooner but fail eventually after you launch it. Or you could choose the other path where you pivot now, develop and validate a new model, launch a little later then you originally hoped for but launch a successful product with a successful model. We chose the second path. </p>

<p>It is safe to say that pretty much every business goes through a pivot at some point in time. How on Earth could you make all of the right decisions and create all the right solutions to life's challenges? There comes a time when your idea will not work out the way you thought it was going to. Be open to pivots. They help you in the end. Accept your idea was not going to work and get back to work. Don't be scared. </p>

<h2 id="ourlastweekofventureschoolreallygoingtomissit">Our last week of Venture School. Really going to miss it...</h2>

<p><strong>The wonderful 6 week accelerated business validation program of Venture School is coming to an end this week.</strong> Venture School has been the greatest thing that has happened for me2 yet and we are really going to miss it. So many great things to say about this program where do I start?! </p>

<p>This Thursday and Friday the me2 team will be at the University participating in workshops, lectures, and practicing for the big pitch event Friday morning that we have all been looking forward to all along. </p>

<p>Friday morning each of the 10 teams in the program will give a 8 minute pitch demonstrating all of the hard work that we have done the past 6 weeks in the program. It is our time to show what we have validated, what we have not validated, and what we are going to do next after leaving the program. An exciting event where we cannot wait to share all of our hard work. </p>

<hr>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">Venture School</a> is growing. They are expanding the program to more cities across the state of Iowa. If you have a business idea, the best decision you could ever make for your idea is send it through Venture School to exercise the lean startup methodology. Give your idea some wheels! Ask myself or any of the me2 team members, we will all recommended it to you in the fullest extent. </p>

<h2 id="wegotanewwebsite">We got a new website!!</h2>

<p>Good by ugly uninformative website and hello to <strong><a href="http://me2nation.com/">our new site</a></strong>! We have wanted somewhere that we can send people that we meet to explain more about what me2 is all about and we think the new me2nation website is a step in the right direction. </p>

<h2 id="thosedreambiggrowherevotescontinuetoflowin">Those Dream Big, Grow Here votes continue to flow in.</h2>

<p>The me2 team is participating in the Dream Big, Grow Here contest competing against a large handful of other businesses in the pre-revenue stage of business. <strong>We continue to spread awareness of our dream of creating a nation of happy kids and you can help us.</strong> The best thing to do is share <a href="http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/EntryDetails.aspx?entry=1072">this website</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HtkJw5HoxQ">our awesome video</a> to people that you know who would love to see hope in the eyes of kids around the nation. </p>

<p>Since the beginning, me2 has been all about the kids. We have had the privaledge to meet some super pre-teen/teenager kids along with parents, counselors, life coaches, youth organizations who all simply <em>care about kids</em>. This is great and all, but what matters truly in the end is that the kids are happy. </p>

<p>First off, it simply has <strong>blown me away</strong> to see how many people are out there who are trying to make a difference for kids. People dedicating their lives to kids every single day not expecting anything in return. I have repeatedly called up family and friends after talking to a group of people and told them about how amazed I was with what that particular group is doing for kids. It is such an honor to personally meet these wonderful people! </p>

<p>Because of the great feedback that we have been receiving, we are starting to see trends in the feedback. We are discovering what kids search for when they seek support and we have some ideas how we can make me2 satisfy those needs. This week we started to take a step back and began to <em>dig a little deeper into how me2 is going to benefit the kids</em>. We are not done asking questions yet! More research needs to be done but progress is definitely being made!</p>

<h2 id="letsmakeanationofhappykidsame2nation">Lets make a nation of happy kids. A me2 nation!</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned last week, me2 is entering in the Dream Big, Grow Here contest. We have <a href="http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/entrydetails.aspx?entry=1072">entered the contest</a> and <a href="http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/entrydetails.aspx?entry=1072">uploaded our video</a> to check out. The reason we are entering the Dream Big, Grow Here contest is because it is a great way to share our dream to everyone. <strong>We want to create a nation full of happy kids. We want to build a me2 nation!</strong></p>

<p>If we win the grant prize, we plan to use the money to cover technical, legal, and marketing costs in order to launch me2 on Android, iOS and the web. The remainder of the money will be used for growth of the product to reach as many kids as possible on the platform. We hope that kids fall in love with me2 and find happiness when using it. We don't want to deny this great tool to a child if we can help it. </p>

<p>Everyone is allowed to vote for the contest once a day every single day up until March 1st when the voting period ends. </p>

<p>Short post this week. The me2 team was out of the office most of the week meeting with counselors, youth organizations, and some kids. Besides that, the creative and product team was up working late trying to <em>make me2 look good</em>. <strong>Working on a new website, a video, and a new logo. Yes, a new logo!</strong></p>

<h3 id="checkoutournewdigs">Check out our new digs!</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/flat-1.png/" alt="new me2 logo"></p>

<p>Getting a new logo for your business is always exciting. We have been working on a new logo for a few weeks now trying to get the style and colors <em>just right</em>. </p>

<p>Out with the blue and in with the green. With me2, we want to be known for an uplifting product. Having an uplifting product means having a fun and uplifting logo. We were looking to create a logo with smooth soft edges and fun calming colors to match. We think this new logo is a step in the right direction. Hope you like it as much as we do! </p>

<h1 id="ournewwebsiteiscomingalong">Our new website is coming along.</h1>

<p><strong>We are tired of looking at that ugly splash page website just as much as you are</strong> (especially because it has the old logo on it now, yuck!). I was working most of my week this week trying to fix that. I cannot share much with you yet, but I will say it is coming <em>very</em> shortly! </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/">1 Million Cups</a>? To a startup or an existing business who is working on making some innovative changes 1 Million Cups is a must to participate in. This week me2 was under the spot light at <a href="https://twitter.com/1millioncupsicr">1 Million Cups ICR</a> at the Geonetric building Wednesday morning and let me tell you, it couldn't have gone better. </p>

<p>We spent a lot of time on this event. So worth it. Audience responded well to the idea with great enthusiasm.  We got feedback from people that we need to emphasis more on as well as ideas we did not quite think of yet. That is what I call a success! </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/Selection_011.png/" alt="me2 presenting at 1 million cups icr"></p>

<h1 id="whatis1millioncups">What is 1 Million Cups?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/About.aspx">1 Million Cups</a> is an event found <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/Events.aspx">all over the United States</a> where entrepreneurs are able to present their business idea to their community and then receive immediate feedback. The event is held every Wednesday from 9:00am - 10am where 2 presenters present to the crowd with a 6 minute presentation followed by 20 minutes of Q and A. The point of the Q and A session is to gain interest and receive real world feedback. 1 Million Cups revolves around community. "What can the community do for you" is the mindset of 1 Million Cups which is really what makes it so special for me to present. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/02/1-Million-Cups.png/" alt="1 million cups logo"></p>

<h1 id="ihavealwaysloved1millioncupsandnowigottopresentsomethingilove">I have always loved 1 Million Cups and now I got to present something I love!</h1>

<p>I have been attending 1 Million Cups for months now in a couple locations. I have really fallen in love with the idea behind the event. It is so inspiring seeing people present their business that they are so passionate about. I always looked forward to the day that I would present something <em>I love</em>. </p>

<p>The entire point of our me2 presentation was to get the audience to understand the product and how it can help kids. I approached the audience full of middle aged adults right away with "Remember back when <em>you</em> were in Jr. High? You had braces, a new pair of Nike shoes and dorky glasses..." to try to get their mind in the right place. </p>

<p>After getting the audience to laugh a little about those old memories, Matt and I bounced back and forth with a little skit demonstrating the product to the audience. I grabbed an old tshirt from my middle school days out of my closet and a headband I had laying around and played the role of a 14 year old from Texas named Justin. Matt played a 12 year old basketball player from Cedar Rapids named Eric. Together, both of us showed the use of me2 to the audience with these two characters we created. It was quite fun!</p>

<h1 id="doyourememberbackwhenyouwereinjrhigh">Do you remember back when you were in Jr. High?</h1>

<p>"<strong>...Well, do you remember how hard it was?..</strong>.Those high expectations. Your parents always on your case to do your homework, turn off the TV, be home by 7 while your friends were out until 9. Guess what? These times have not changed. Kids still go through these typical expectations like kids always have. But today kids have no way to escape from their issues..."</p>

<p>Today kids decide to go online to express their struggles which is great because it helps them get it off their chest but this results in bullies having 24x7 access to their victims. <em>*This is where me2 comes in. A fun, safe, positive environment for kids to go online and share their emotions. *</em></p>

<h1 id="thankyou">Thank you!!</h1>

<p>We want to give a big shout out to everyone who attended our 1 Million Cups presentation Wednesday and gave us all the amazing feedback that we were looking forward to. Our 1 Million Cups appearance was very positive and could not have gone better. If your business or organization has an idea they would like to present and receive some feedback on, I highly encourage you to speak at a 1 Million Cups event near you! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/tominsky">David Tominsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahebinder">Sarah Binder</a> for the opportunity to come to <a href="https://twitter.com/1MillionCupsICR">1 Million Cups ICR</a>. </p>

<p><strong>This week the me2 team was focused on the opening workshops of the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School</a> program.</strong> We are only 3 days into the program but I can already see the extreme benefits the program is going to be able to provide for our product, our customers, the team and most importantly: the kids. </p>

<h1 id="findthetrueproblemandthenbuildyourproduct">Find the true problem and <em>then</em> build your product.</h1>

<p>The Venture School program offered by the University of Iowa is becoming a very successful well known program now sprouting new sessions over the whole state of Iowa. The 6 week accelerated program concentrates on creating and validating a <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc">business model</a> for your business idea. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startup</a> business method, find your customers major problems and build a product from there. </p>

<p>Because of Startup Weekend, our team essentially did the opposite where we built a product from an idea and then tried to find a way that customers would pay for it. So starting out Venture School we had to somewhat start over with our business idea. They had us all stop thinking about our product and instead find the true problems of our customer and then rebuild our product from this knowledge. </p>

<p>This week our team along with 9 other startups worked all day Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on the <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/10/24/17577/">value proposition and customer segment</a> of the business model. These help you discover the true needs of your customer along with who your customer truly is. <em>What</em> is the problem and <em>who</em> has the problem?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2370/content/images/2015/01/value-prop-design.jpg/" alt=""></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Each team came into the program with a business model draft completed where we all found out quickly that they are all quite wrong. Each day of the opening workshops we gave everyone an update to our buisness model through a pitch presentation. <strong>It turns out that none of the groups, including us, truly know what value we are delivering through our product.</strong> </p>

<p>When stating the value that your business gives to your customer, it has nothing to do with your product. Do not even think about your product. What is the true problem of your customer? With me2 being the example, the fact that me2 provides emotional support to kids is <em>not</em> a value. Value propositions need to be proven false depending on who you talk to. Everyone agrees that happiness is important to a child so that is not value. <strong>What is the true problem to your customer?</strong> Sure emotional support is important to a child but that is a <em>feature</em> of the product. What does emotional support <em>do</em> for kids? That is more of what a value proposition should be. </p>

<h1 id="ventureschoolhasallowedustotakeastepback">Venture school has allowed us to take a step back.</h1>

<p>Being pulled back from building the product and instead starting with step one doing customer validation to find the true problem you are trying to solve is the best decision for a startup to make. You have a cool idea? Great! Now just be patient and spend some time validating that your idea truly solves a problem. </p>

<p>We are taking this time to talk to people and practice some team building. It is like starting from scratch but not completely. We are simply taking a step back to make the product better. So far I am a true believer in the lean startup method. Startups are not just small versions of big businesses. They take a completely different approach. Go on, give it a try!</p>

How you prepare for battle. -- week 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2</h1>

<p><strong>The me2 team has been in discovery mode</strong>. Lots and lots of research across the board. We are spending time preparing for some tasks in the weeks to come. The marketing team was actively researching organizations in the area to connect with while the development team was doing a refresher on some old knowledge. Simply put, we are preparing for battle (our launch day. The day we enter the market).</p>

<p>It was a quiet week in the office where everyone had their headphones on tight staring at the computer screen with some phone calls on the side. We have been preparing some website and social media content to connect with all the positive kids out there but besides that, it has been all business.</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="wehavebeenconductingalotofresearch">We have been conducting a lot of research.</h1>

<p>What is funny is now that I think about it, we did not really plan on conducting research as a team, we just naturally started to do it. The marketing team discussed it amongst each other and decided to conduct various types of marketing research such as social media techniques and customer discovery (You know, the typical market research that all businesses conduct when first starting out). <strong>Startups know of a problem they are trying to solve but they need to know that problem inside and out to the best of their ability if they want to <em>truly</em> solve that problem.</strong></p>

<p>We are entering a market that none of us are experts at. All of us were kids once and we all went through some hard times but that does not make us experts. In order to conduct business in a market, you need to understand the market to the very best of your ability. We have some great ideas about our market and users but it can always be better. From advice we have received, spending some good time to better understand the industry you are entering is time well spent. </p>

<h1 id="thisresearchisnotjustexclusivetothebusinesssideofthebusiness">This research is not just exclusive to the business side of the business...</h1>

<p>...even the development side has been conducting research! I have been researching for weeks now on the product side making decisions on the technologies and techniques we will be using to build our platform. This week specifically I was refreshing my knowledge on some web technologies that I have not used in a while. Brad, our designer, is also beginning to  research some design techniques we will be needing in the future. </p>

<p>From a product standpoint, my team is also preparing for battle. We hope that once we release our product, kids absolutely fall in love with it. Kids are going to count on this product being available at all times especially when they are at their worst and need that emotional support that we are providing. Our platform needs to be dependable and able to stand up to stress. I am preparing our team to build a safe, dependable, stable platform available to all of our users they will love. </p>

<h1 id="onceyoustartthereisnostopping">Once you start, there is no stopping.</h1>

<p>Once you enter battle, it becomes harder to make changes. Starting out a business, making those key decisions early on that you are going to be able to tolerate months or years down the road are important to make. Prepare your army then jump right in! Once you start, it is full steam ahead with no slowing down so better be prepared now then later!</p>

The me2 team is now working all day every day making dreams come true. It is only a matter of time now until kids have a safe environment on the Internet to have fun and support each other. </p>

<h1 id="weareme2">We are me2.</h1>

<p>For those of you who may not know, we are me2. A safe environment online for kids where they can support each other to get through their hard times. Every young person struggles at some point in life so we are here to provide that environment where they feel safe to express that. </p>

<p>Monday of this week we started working full-time out of the <a href="http://crvault.com">Vault</a> co-working space in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Co-working is the idea of many different people all working on different projects sharing office space together to create an environment that encourages collaberation, positive energy and motivation. Moving into the Vault was a decision that we made to help us work as hard as possible through our launch where we can be with people with the same dream as us: create and maintain a successful business. The Vault has been around for a few years now in a beautiful building where many successful businesses started out of. How inspiring!</p>

<h1 id="whatistocomeverysoon">What is to come very soon.</h1>

<p>Our team spent a bit of time this week doing a great deal of meeting members of the Vault space and doing some team organization to get everyone's schedules figured out. Besides that, we spent a great deal of time planning out some fun social media activities that we will be starting soon so be sure to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/me2nation">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/me2nation">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/me2nation">Facebook</a> pages to keep up with that (have your kids follow us if they are on any of these networks with permission from their parents of course). We also have a new <a href="http://me2nation.com">website splash page</a> created until our website is complete. We have also started a new <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com">company blog</a> (which you are reading this from) that we will use to share out experiences and progress on every week. </p>

<h2 id="evenmoreexcitingnews">Even <em>more</em> exciting news.</h2>

<p>me2 is very excited to announce that we have been chosen to participate in the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School program</a> starting January 20th! Venture School is a 6 week accelerated program for new startup companies to validate their business and ultimately raise their chances of success through networking, mentoring and customer discovery. We have big plans for Venture School where the sky is the limit. </p>
