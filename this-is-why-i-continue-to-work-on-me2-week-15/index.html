           <h3 id="thisweekintheworldofme2">This week in the world of me2.</h3>

<p>The past couple of weeks the me2 team has not had the most time to dedicate to the project. Unfortunately because of the way life is we have all needed to spend a majority of our time on other priorities. Myself alone, I was out of town most of the week working on various other commitments. There are some exciting plans in the making but unfortunetely, it is too early to tell right now. I can't wait to write a post about it! </p>

<h3 id="whenthetimesgettoughkeeponpushing">When the times get tough, keep on pushing.</h3>

<p>They say in the startup world everything in the beginning is super exciting and you hear nothing but good news and then the real work comes after all of that starts to settle down. </p>

<p>Myself along with the rest of the team has been working on this project for 15 weeks now. <strong>At the beginning it was nothing but excitment that we were going to change the world.</strong> Everything was new to us and there was no such thing as bad news. Everyone we talked to thought the idea was super awesome and they thanked us for working on it to make the lives of teenagers better around the world. </p>

<p>Now that we are to this point where the idea is solidified and it is time to really get down and dirty to build the product, this is where the real work comes. It is time to round up the time, money, and effort to make this dream a reality. Because of the industry that we work in, these 3 things are pretty tough to come by. </p>

<p>Because of the way life works and the society we live in, none of us are able to work on the idea full-time anymore. Getting sucked into our typical day-to-day lives it becomes tough to stick to a big project like me2 especially because there is not much coming back in return for the hard work put into it so far. </p>

<h3 id="thisiswhyicontinuetoworkonme2">This is why I continue to work on me2.</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago, <strong>I had the honor of speaking to over a hundred students about my life as a software engineer and an entrepreneur</strong>. I spoke to 2 middle schools and 1 high school in the local area as they invited me to come to give the students exposure into what career paths were out there. I loved every minute of speaking with them because they ate everything up that I had to say (especially because we made an Android app from scratch during the presentation and installed it to my phone then a few lucky students got to press the button!). </p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/IMAG0619.jpg" alt="thank you card from student" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you card from a middle school student.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After doing the event, I got a couple big packets of mail from the schools loaded with thank you cards from the students. I opened up the yellow envelopes with a big smile on my face ready to hear students tell me how much they love entrepreneurship and developing software <em>but I got something more.</em></p>

<p>I did end up receiving a large handful of cards that stated how they loved my career, but I also received a large handful that gave me messages like, <em>"Thank you for working on me2.", "I am going to have lots of fun hanging out on me2."</em> and the quote from the picture above, <strong>"I am happy to have a support system thanks to you!"...Wow...That is the whole point of why I joined up with this project. I wanted to provide a support system to people who are in need. Back to work!</strong> </p>
