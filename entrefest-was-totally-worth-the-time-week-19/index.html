           <h3 id="didyougotoentrefestlastweek">Did you go to EntreFest last week?</h3>

<p>Good thing in my last post I talked about having <a href="http://blog.me2nation.org/sorry-when-you-have-momentum-it-is-hard-to-stop-it-week-18/index.html">such a good momentum</a> going as this past week I was out of the office completely. </p>

<p>Wednesday through Friday of last week myself along with 1000 of other entrepreneurs attended <a href="http://www.entrefest.com/">EntreFEST</a> in downtown Iowa City, Iowa. This was my first year attending along with half the crowd as attendance went from 500 to 1000 from just last year (and it will for sure go up again next year!). <strong>Going into EntreFEST I was not really looking forward to it as much as I had hoped but after just the first hour, I realized it was totally worth every minute and every penny spent on it.</strong></p>

<h3 id="afterbeginningdevelopmentofthemvpididnotwanttotakeabreak">After beginning development of the MVP, I did not want to take a break.</h3>

<p>Before leaving for EntreFEST I began developing the MVP for me2. It is such an exciting time once you start developing the MVP that you simply do not want to stop building it. You start to see the solution you have spent your heart and soul on for months come to life. Because of this, I was honestly not that excited for going to EntreFEST because I did not want to stop. I felt it was simply "not the right time for me" but then after I said that, I stopped myself because no matter where you are in your business, you will <em>always</em> say "it is not the right time for me" so you might as well just ignore that and go. </p>

<p>I have been to entrepreneurial conferences before and they were ok. I did not get too much out of them so I was hoping this time would be different. Right from the beginning, my very first session I attended made me realize this conference would be different. It started to solve problems on culture that I have been lightly struggling with for months now with me2. I knew that I was in for a treat. </p>

<h3 id="iambackandiamreadyforaction">I am back and I am ready for action.</h3>

<p>Working non-stop on me2 for many months now (as well as other projects on the side), it is so important to step back and evaluate what you are working on, your company, your vision, your customers, etc. This is something I am very bad at myself. When I start something, I usually never stop to evaluate until it is complete. This is bad as you can start to dig a hole for yourself, your team, and your business if you are not careful. </p>

<p>Going to EntreFEST helped me to stop and evaluate. I have been emerged into the business model and MVP for weeks now not focusing on anything else. I went to sessions on company culture, priorities, marketing, sales, and many others that all gave me different perspectives to think about. Because I have been fully emerged for weeks on the business model, I did not take the time to think of other parts of the business. Luckily, it is myself working full-time with help from a couple others part-time so me stepping back and evaluating effects pretty much just myself but it is still very much important to do. </p>

<p>After the conference, I went home to spend time with some family for memorial day weekend. That time has been great and today I am back at it writing about my experience with EntreFEST and catching up on email. I am also beginning to write about all my notes on EntreFEST on <a href="http://levibostian.com/">my personal blog</a>. Those posts will be out as soon as I can. After that, I will be back into business building a product that changes the lives of people around the world. </p>
