<p>Have you seen our <a href="http://me2nation.org/">new website yet?!</a> Last week I spent my me2 time on creating a new website replacing the old look. This new website focuses on demonstrating what the me2 app is all about and explaining what me2 nation is all about. me2 helps and heals and is driven by the community. </p>

<p>I have wanted to create a new website for me2 the past few weeks as the product focus has changed a bit since the original website first launched a few months ago. The team members have changed, the product has changed, the business model has changed, the target user has changed, etc. So much has changed, it was time to get a new website. This one also looks much better on mobile and will be easier to maintain as I built it from scratch. Hope you like it!</p>

<h3 id="me2isdrivenbypeertopeersupport">me2 is driven by peer to peer support.</h3>

<p>Originally when I started working on the me2 product, the product was going to focus on providing expert advice into the application. The app was going to be your one stop shop for talking to a professional asking for advice while also gaining emotional support from other users on the app. me2 was designed for a place of relief. You can still use me2 as a place of relief but it is now much more then that. </p>

<p>I have thought to myself numerous times the past couple months, <strong>why are we trying to provide expert advice to teenagers when the teenagers themselves are the experts!</strong> I have gone to counselors before, I have used the services of trained professionals, I do believe that professionals have expertise that teenagers benefit greatly from. I also believe that teenagers are way smarter then we think they are. And I believe even more greatly in the fact that advice from someone with a degree is not as effective as advice from an average Joe that has lived through your struggle himself/herself. </p>

<h4 id="notyourtypicalcounselingsession">Not your typical counseling session.</h4>

<p>The new focus for me2 is to take advantage of the fact that advice from average Joes is the best advice you could ever ask for. Have you ever heard us say the phrase, "you are not alone" when talking about me2? No matter what situation you are facing in life, you are definitely not alone. There are hundreds of thousands of people who have gone through what you are going through. When you are facing this situation, you can make an appointment with a counselor or some other form of professional emotional support specialist or you could use the power of peer to peer support on me2 to connect with these people who remembers going through your pain. </p>

<p>I would like to add that me2 will still give access to professionals as there is still a need for this type of service. Even though peer to peer is powerful, we understand that professional support is still needed at times. me2 is an alternative form of emotional healing that I believe is very powerful and benefitional. </p>

<p>I am so very excited to release this gift out to the world and see how it works in the real world. I hope that it changes the way that we heal each other. Well, it may not change much as peer support has been around for a long time such as alcoholics anonymous but maybe it will make more people seek for peer support? Who knows. Either way, I am very excited. Back to building. </p>

<p>...check out my latest <a href="http://levibostian.com/youre-always-against-something-until-it-happens-to-you/index.html">blog post</a> on my personal site. Here, I try to give a little more of a personal example of how I see peer to peer support working. It was at this particilar moment in my life that I realized, you have no idea how someone feels until you have lived through that moment yourself. </p>

<p>Everyone struggles at some point in life. No matter the situation, we are here to say me2. @me2nation <br />
