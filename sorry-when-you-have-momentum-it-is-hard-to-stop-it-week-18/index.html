<p>I am sorry I am just now getting to this post this week. I like to get posts done earlier in the week but I had such a great momentum going! I did not want to take the time to slow down and write a post so I am just now getting to it today before the weekend comes. </p>

<h3 id="itisbuildingtime">It is building time.</h3>

<p>This week I found this big rush of energy that I do not know where it came from. On the team's scrum board I had this sprint's iteration prepared as well as next week's iteration prepared and I ended up getting through this week and next week's work all before today. Not sure how it happened but it was sure a lot of fun. </p>

<p>I ended up staying late each night working until I absolutely had to stop and go home for the night. Now that I think of it, I might have found out why I had so much fun and energy. I think it was because I am now beginning to build the product! I got to program this week!</p>

<p>I am very excited and nervous about building the product now. From everyone that I have interviewed and talked to they have stated a need for a product like this. So now is the time to see if they are telling the truth about it. I can see why people value the idea of an MVP so much now...</p>

<h3 id="iamhavingalotoffunbuildingandallbutimightstepbackandworkonthemvpidea">I am having a lot of fun building and all, but I might step back and work on the 'MVP' idea.</h3>

<p>Ever since October I have wanted to see the me2 product finished. I worked on it during the weekend with this passionate group of people and we created a product at the end of the weekend and all I could think about was how badly I wish it was something real. Being able to sit down and develop this week got me so excited because I was seeing the product come to life like I have been waiting for for months and months now. Luckily entrepreneurs are pretty patient people and I have been able to wait. </p>

<h4 id="ihopeyouarethinkingrightnowwhyareyoubuildingtheproductwhenyoushouldbetestingyourideawithamvp">I hope you are thinking right now, <em>why are you building the product when you should be testing your idea with a MVP?</em></h4>

<p>Thinking about my idea of an MVP for me2, I could not find a good way to test the concept in a convenient, safe, quick and testable way. Just a couple weeks ago while I was driving home (where I get most of my good ideas, seriously) I thought of one. </p>

<p>Of course spending time hacking away at a MVP, marketing and testing a MVP does not sound like fun as it requires time and potentially money but it is of course less risky then building the product then seeing your demand rise or sink. It is even harder thinking about a MVP when I am a developer who could whip up an app pretty quickly and start making money from potential customers but I still see such a big value in the idea of an MVP that I still see it worth the time and energy. </p>

<p>I am planning out this MVP idea further within the next week and plan it out with the rest of my team. I still think it is very much worth it but I want to see how testable it truly is and see if we are able to view analytics on the user activity. If this is so, then you may see a me2 MVP come out very shortly! </p>
