            <p><strong>Woohoo!!!</strong> This week marked a very exciting moment in the history of me2. <strong>We have began work on me2 full-time!</strong> Not only that, but we are working together in an office! The me2 team is now working all day every day making dreams come true. It is only a matter of time now until kids have a safe environment on the Internet to have fun and support each other. </p>

<h1 id="weareme2">We are me2.</h1>

<p>For those of you who may not know, we are me2. A safe environment online for kids where they can support each other to get through their hard times. Every young person struggles at some point in life so we are here to provide that environment where they feel safe to express that. </p>

<p>Monday of this week we started working full-time out of the <a href="http://crvault.com">Vault</a> co-working space in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Co-working is the idea of many different people all working on different projects sharing office space together to create an environment that encourages collaberation, positive energy and motivation. Moving into the Vault was a decision that we made to help us work as hard as possible through our launch where we can be with people with the same dream as us: create and maintain a successful business. The Vault has been around for a few years now in a beautiful building where many successful businesses started out of. How inspiring!</p>

<h1 id="whatistocomeverysoon">What is to come very soon.</h1>

<p>Our team spent a bit of time this week doing a great deal of meeting members of the Vault space and doing some team organization to get everyone's schedules figured out. Besides that, we spent a great deal of time planning out some fun social media activities that we will be starting soon so be sure to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/me2nation">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/me2nation">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/me2nation">Facebook</a> pages to keep up with that (have your kids follow us if they are on any of these networks with permission from their parents of course). We also have a new <a href="http://me2nation.com">website splash page</a> created until our website is complete. We have also started a new <a href="http://blog.me2nation.com">company blog</a> (which you are reading this from) that we will use to share out experiences and progress on every week. </p>

<h2 id="evenmoreexcitingnews">Even <em>more</em> exciting news.</h2>

<p>me2 is very excited to announce that we have been chosen to participate in the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School program</a> starting January 20th! Venture School is a 6 week accelerated program for new startup companies to validate their business and ultimately raise their chances of success through networking, mentoring and customer discovery. We have big plans for Venture School where the sky is the limit. </p>

<p>Everyone here at me2 is moving at full speed making progress to launch the me2 web and mobile app. We have been thinking of some <em>very</em> cool ideas that we cannot wait to share with all of you. Thank you everyone for your continued support. </p>
