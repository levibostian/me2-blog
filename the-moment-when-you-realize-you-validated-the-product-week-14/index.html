<p>This week I began to work on <strong>building the product!</strong> I have not been able to dig into the code quite yet (the suspense is killing me) but I began to at least start the <em>process</em> of developing the product. </p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/04/IMAG0614.jpg" alt="user stories created" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stack of my user stories created this week.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I spent the early part of the week making phone calls as well as reflecting on past notes I wrote down during interviews. I have had some parts of the me2 product that I have been on the edge about for a while and I needed some clarification. </p>

<p>After hanging up these calls and reading of past notes, I put on my head phones, turned on a long mix of music, grabbed a couple notepads and wrote as many user stories as I could possibly think of. Time to start connecting the dots! </p>

<h2 id="iiithinktheproductisvalidated">I...I...I think the product is validated.</h2>

<p>Looking at the product right now compared to where it was back in October at Startup Weekend is absolutely amazing. Back then, I thought the product was pretty solid and was ready to continue developing it immediately after the weekend was over. After starting on it full-time, reading about the lean-startup methodology and going through Venture School I really started to think, do I really <em>know</em> that this product is solid? </p>

<p>I have been asking potential users questions for months now trying to get a better idea of how this product should be developed. Every single step along the way there were times where I thought, "This thing is ready to build. I can see just what the users are looking for in this product." Then two minutes later I thought, "Awwww, I am still on the edge about this part. What am I going to do about this situation? What if...". More validation had to be done on these parts.</p>

<p>After I got off the phone early this week I had a moment. I had this feeling inside telling me that <em>this</em> is what the users are looking for. They helped answer those last few big questions on my mind and <strong>I finally had this feeling where <em>I knew</em> what my users were looking for in a product.</strong> My product validation hit a sweet point where I actually knew what the users were looking for! Wow, I have never had a feeling like that before! </p>

<h4 id="whenyoufeelinsecureaskmorequestions">When you feel insecure, ask more questions.</h4>

<p>For the past couple of months there have been parts of the product that I was not very comfortable with. Parts that I wasn't quite sure if the users would find it valuable and parts that I felt were going to be really difficult to overcome (I felt these parts <em>could</em> be overcome but also felt there had to be a better way). I reflected on these insecurities and wondered if those were things that I was just going to have to deal with or if there was a way to overcome these challenges better. I decided to just keep doing more validation. </p>

<p>Then it was this week after I got off the phone that I had the big "Aha!" moment. All of those insecurities seemed to float away. I have no idea how it happened, but while I was on the phone I asked a couple questions that got my friends going off on the path I was looking for. They gave me information that I have been searching for months for. </p>

<p>I guess patience is a good thing sometimes. You will know when the product has been validated. You will get a gut feeling inside telling you that you hit a sweet spot. Just keep asking questions until you get that feeling. </p>

<h4 id="havingavalidatedproductfeelsohsogood">Having a validated product feels oh, so good!</h4>

<p>Product validation has taken some time, but reflecting on what the product has turned into and how confident I am about the product now I would say it is very much worth it. I have been starting businesses half my life and programming just as long and I have never been this confident in what the customers/users were looking for in the product. It feels oh, so good! Now it is time to go start building! </p>
