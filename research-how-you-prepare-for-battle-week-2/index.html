<p><strong>The me2 team has been in discovery mode</strong>. Lots and lots of research across the board. We are spending time preparing for some tasks in the weeks to come. The marketing team was actively researching organizations in the area to connect with while the development team was doing a refresher on some old knowledge. Simply put, we are preparing for battle (our launch day. The day we enter the market).</p>

<p>It was a quiet week in the office where everyone had their headphones on tight staring at the computer screen with some phone calls on the side. We have been preparing some website and social media content to connect with all the positive kids out there but besides that, it has been all business.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="wehavebeenconductingalotofresearch">We have been conducting a lot of research.</h1>

<p>What is funny is now that I think about it, we did not really plan on conducting research as a team, we just naturally started to do it. The marketing team discussed it amongst each other and decided to conduct various types of marketing research such as social media techniques and customer discovery (You know, the typical market research that all businesses conduct when first starting out). <strong>Startups know of a problem they are trying to solve but they need to know that problem inside and out to the best of their ability if they want to <em>truly</em> solve that problem.</strong></p>

<p>We are entering a market that none of us are experts at. All of us were kids once and we all went through some hard times but that does not make us experts. In order to conduct business in a market, you need to understand the market to the very best of your ability. We have some great ideas about our market and users but it can always be better. From advice we have received, spending some good time to better understand the industry you are entering is time well spent. </p>

<h1 id="thisresearchisnotjustexclusivetothebusinesssideofthebusiness">This research is not just exclusive to the business side of the business...</h1>

<p>...even the development side has been conducting research! I have been researching for weeks now on the product side making decisions on the technologies and techniques we will be using to build our platform. This week specifically I was refreshing my knowledge on some web technologies that I have not used in a while. Brad, our designer, is also beginning to  research some design techniques we will be needing in the future. </p>

<p>From a product standpoint, my team is also preparing for battle. We hope that once we release our product, kids absolutely fall in love with it. Kids are going to count on this product being available at all times especially when they are at their worst and need that emotional support that we are providing. Our platform needs to be dependable and able to stand up to stress. I am preparing our team to build a safe, dependable, stable platform available to all of our users they will love. </p>

<h1 id="onceyoustartthereisnostopping">Once you start, there is no stopping.</h1>

<p>Once you enter battle, it becomes harder to make changes. Starting out a business, making those key decisions early on that you are going to be able to tolerate months or years down the road are important to make. Prepare your army then jump right in! Once you start, it is full steam ahead with no slowing down so better be prepared now then later!</p>
