<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/">1 Million Cups</a>? To a startup or an existing business who is working on making some innovative changes 1 Million Cups is a must to participate in. This week me2 was under the spot light at <a href="https://twitter.com/1millioncupsicr">1 Million Cups ICR</a> at the Geonetric building Wednesday morning and let me tell you, it couldn't have gone better. </p>

<p>We spent a lot of time on this event. So worth it. Audience responded well to the idea with great enthusiasm.  We got feedback from people that we need to emphasis more on as well as ideas we did not quite think of yet. That is what I call a success! </p>

<h1 id="whatis1millioncups">What is 1 Million Cups?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/About.aspx">1 Million Cups</a> is an event found <a href="http://www.1millioncups.com/Events.aspx">all over the United States</a> where entrepreneurs are able to present their business idea to their community and then receive immediate feedback. The event is held every Wednesday from 9:00am - 10am where 2 presenters present to the crowd with a 6 minute presentation followed by 20 minutes of Q and A. The point of the Q and A session is to gain interest and receive real world feedback. 1 Million Cups revolves around community. "What can the community do for you" is the mindset of 1 Million Cups which is really what makes it so special for me to present. </p>

<h1 id="ihavealwaysloved1millioncupsandnowigottopresentsomethingilove">I have always loved 1 Million Cups and now I got to present something I love!</h1>

<p>I have been attending 1 Million Cups for months now in a couple locations. I have really fallen in love with the idea behind the event. It is so inspiring seeing people present their business that they are so passionate about. I always looked forward to the day that I would present something <em>I love</em>. </p>

<p>The entire point of our me2 presentation was to get the audience to understand the product and how it can help kids. I approached the audience full of middle aged adults right away with "Remember back when <em>you</em> were in Jr. High? You had braces, a new pair of Nike shoes and dorky glasses..." to try to get their mind in the right place. </p>

<p>After getting the audience to laugh a little about those old memories, Matt and I bounced back and forth with a little skit demonstrating the product to the audience. I grabbed an old tshirt from my middle school days out of my closet and a headband I had laying around and played the role of a 14 year old from Texas named Justin. Matt played a 12 year old basketball player from Cedar Rapids named Eric. Together, both of us showed the use of me2 to the audience with these two characters we created. It was quite fun!</p>

<h1 id="doyourememberbackwhenyouwereinjrhigh">Do you remember back when you were in Jr. High?</h1>

<p>"<strong>...Well, do you remember how hard it was?..</strong>.Those high expectations. Your parents always on your case to do your homework, turn off the TV, be home by 7 while your friends were out until 9. Guess what? These times have not changed. Kids still go through these typical expectations like kids always have. But today kids have no way to escape from their issues..."</p>

<p>Today kids decide to go online to express their struggles which is great because it helps them get it off their chest but this results in bullies having 24x7 access to their victims. <em>*This is where me2 comes in. A fun, safe, positive environment for kids to go online and share their emotions. *</em></p>

<h1 id="thankyou">Thank you!!</h1>

<p>We want to give a big shout out to everyone who attended our 1 Million Cups presentation Wednesday and gave us all the amazing feedback that we were looking forward to. Our 1 Million Cups appearance was very positive and could not have gone better. If your business or organization has an idea they would like to present and receive some feedback on, I highly encourage you to speak at a 1 Million Cups event near you! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/tominsky">David Tominsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahebinder">Sarah Binder</a> for the opportunity to come to <a href="https://twitter.com/1MillionCupsICR">1 Million Cups ICR</a>. </p>
