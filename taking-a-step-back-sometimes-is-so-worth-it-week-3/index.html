<p><strong>This week the me2 team was focused on the opening workshops of the <a href="http://www.iowajpec.org/entrepreneur-support/venture-school/">University of Iowa's Venture School</a> program.</strong> We are only 3 days into the program but I can already see the extreme benefits the program is going to be able to provide for our product, our customers, the team and most importantly: the kids. </p>

<h1 id="findthetrueproblemandthenbuildyourproduct">Find the true problem and <em>then</em> build your product.</h1>

<p>The Venture School program offered by the University of Iowa is becoming a very successful well known program now sprouting new sessions over the whole state of Iowa. The 6 week accelerated program concentrates on creating and validating a <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc">business model</a> for your business idea. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startup</a> business method, find your customers major problems and build a product from there. </p>

<p>Because of Startup Weekend, our team essentially did the opposite where we built a product from an idea and then tried to find a way that customers would pay for it. So starting out Venture School we had to somewhat start over with our business idea. They had us all stop thinking about our product and instead find the true problems of our customer and then rebuild our product from this knowledge. </p>

<p>This week our team along with 9 other startups worked all day Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on the <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/10/24/17577/">value proposition and customer segment</a> of the business model. These help you discover the true needs of your customer along with who your customer truly is. <em>What</em> is the problem and <em>who</em> has the problem?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Each team came into the program with a business model draft completed where we all found out quickly that they are all quite wrong. Each day of the opening workshops we gave everyone an update to our buisness model through a pitch presentation. <strong>It turns out that none of the groups, including us, truly know what value we are delivering through our product.</strong> </p>

<p>When stating the value that your business gives to your customer, it has nothing to do with your product. Do not even think about your product. What is the true problem of your customer? With me2 being the example, the fact that me2 provides emotional support to kids is <em>not</em> a value. Value propositions need to be proven false depending on who you talk to. Everyone agrees that happiness is important to a child so that is not value. <strong>What is the true problem to your customer?</strong> Sure emotional support is important to a child but that is a <em>feature</em> of the product. What does emotional support <em>do</em> for kids? That is more of what a value proposition should be. </p>

<h1 id="ventureschoolhasallowedustotakeastepback">Venture school has allowed us to take a step back.</h1>

<p>Being pulled back from building the product and instead starting with step one doing customer validation to find the true problem you are trying to solve is the best decision for a startup to make. You have a cool idea? Great! Now just be patient and spend some time validating that your idea truly solves a problem. </p>

<p>We are taking this time to talk to people and practice some team building. It is like starting from scratch but not completely. We are simply taking a step back to make the product better. So far I am a true believer in the lean startup method. Startups are not just small versions of big businesses. They take a completely different approach. Go on, give it a try!</p>
